      <h4>
        You might feel sad after you lose something that's really important to
        you, or when you feel like you have lost something important.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h4>
        When people are sad, they sometimes cry or distance themselves from
        others.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h4>
        Sadness is not a bad feeling. It can help you process your emotions
        better and it gives you the space to continue or make a new path for
        yourself.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h4>
        Sadness might also help you connect with others. If someone you love is
        feeling sad, you can be there to support them. This will make them feel
        better, and you will be a good friend to them.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h4>
        It's important that you recognize your sadness instead of pushing it
        away, or trying to cover it up with another emotion, like anger.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h4>
        Sometimes, sadness doesn't feel like sadness. You can feel really really
        angry or even nothing at all when you're sad.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h4>
        Talking or spending time with the people you love can make you feel more
        positive when you're sad. Playing with your favorite games or eating
        your favorite food can also be a way to deal wiht the sadness.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h4>
        Everyone feels sad. Sadness, like other emotions, will get better over
        time.
