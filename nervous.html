       <h4>
         Feeling nervous or anxious sometimes is completely normal. It's our body's natural way of telling us that we are uncomfortable with a situation, person, or decision. 
      </h4><br>
        <h4>
           Most of the time, these feelings will go away with time, and our mood will transition to something different. 
        </h4><br>
      <h4>
        If these feelings get overwhelming, or if you feel like you cannot handle them, speaking to a trusted adult is a great first step. It might also help to try a breathing exercise like the ones on our Resources page, or to write down your feelings in the journal.
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
        Many people feel nervous in every day life, even the adults and other kids around you! Your worries are completely valid and there is no shame in feeling like something is scary or out of your control.
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
        Nervousness is not dangerous, and the level of anxiousness you feel might change every day. It can even help us in some situations.
      </h4><br>
      <h4>
        Some signs of nervousness are physical, like sweaty palms and a shaky breath. Other signs are mental, like racing thoughts or fear. Finally, another sign you might be feeling nervous is if you are avoiding something for a long time, like your homework, school, or another activity.
