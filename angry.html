      <h4>
        Anger can be an overwhelming emotion, but it can also help ourselves
        deal with uncomfortable situations and external pressures. Despite it's
        negative effects at times, anger is energizing, communicates to others
        how you are feeling, and stops intense, dangerous feelings from taking
        over.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h4>
        Your heart rate might increase, you might yell, you might feel like
        crying, and you might feel like hurting someone when you're angry. It's
        important to safely manage these feelings and take safe steps to treat
        yourself and others with kindness.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h4>
        To manage anger, try taking a few deep breaths, or counting down from 10
        slowly in your head. You can also go for a run, listen to your favorite
        music, or drink a large glass of water to help calm down.
      </h4>
      <br />
      <h4>
        Sometimes, anger is a sign of a larger emotional or social issue. You
        might feel angry when you are very very sad, or when something negative
        feels like it's taking over your life. No matter the reason why you are
        angry, you can always find support for your feelings.
